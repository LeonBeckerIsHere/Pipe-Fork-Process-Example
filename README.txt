I use g++ to compile the program
I've provided a bash shell script to quickly compile, run, and show all relevant files

Usage:
./run.sh <name>

If it fails to work for some reason
you can call make and then ./run <name>

I have also included the test data I was using which you can use for <name>:
greeting
animal
ghost
